We (most surely) have all been there. Not remembering what we did yesterday. Not remembering what we did the day before. Usually this is not an issue at all—however if you built something and are unable to remember how to use it, it actually becomes a problem pretty fast.  
Games do have instructions, technical devices are usually explained in manuals and for this website I decided to create a showcase that on the one side allows readers to get an idea of what this blog section is capable of and on the other side serves as a handbook for the auther to collect all the variables and settings in one place.
{:.intro}

Besides this article—I recently published a blog post that provides much more insights in my thoughts and ideas and why I decided to shut down my previous site and recreated it (mostly) from the grounds up. So if you are more interested in the theoretical aspects rather than the practical approach feel free to head over to [this post](/blog/2018/Time-to-start-over-again/).

What I wanted to create can be explained pretty straight forward. Easy to use and read. Created to present its content in a minimalistic yet very powerful way. Always with an approach in mind that allows to run this static websites backend without more plugins or addons than absolutely necessary. Javascript is required ingredient for this website and while this—of course—means that there is some work to be done on every site acces, it at the same time allows to outsource steps that often run on the server side and create kind of an independence from cluttered, most often not really nevessary server backends.

## The Showcase
Speaking of the new website I developed in recent months the following section should be seen as an overview of the capabilities and features (from a developer point of view) of this blog.  
All elements which are shown below also go along with a section of *raw* text which allows to get a feeling of how to use those markdown/js mixtures in order to make use of the full power of the underlying code.

While all of the samples could be directly coded in *html* this blog makes heavily use of <span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote__toggle">kramdown</span><span class="sidenote__note">[kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) is a free MIT-licensed Ruby library for parsing and converting a superset of Markdown. It is completely written in Ruby, supports standard Markdown [...] and various extensions [...].</span></span> which basically allows to not just parse the common [markdown](http://spec.commonmark.org/) syntax it also allows to make use of some additional features like a very easy to implement footnote solution or the Attribut List Definitions[^1] (ALD) which allows to add classes, ids or even multiple attributes to html blocks or inline elements all from within markdown and therefore without writing actual html code.  
Since this blog is powered by the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), kramdown is supported out of the box as it is its default markdown parsers—so if you are not familiar with either Jekyll or [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) I highly recommend to check them out—both of them are a real win and forerunner for the static web community.

I also like to point out while there is of course the possibility to extend Jekyll with add-ons to create pretty much the same output as shown below with a much smaller javascript effort I decided to not implement those features in the Jekyll backend but instead using a browser-side approach.  
Surely it should be always taken into account that (especially in a static site environment) a server side approach strips a lot of resource-hungry lines of code and instead parses everything in a on-time process which afterwards serves any actual enduser with a already *"fully finished"* website. However since I also was interested in developing a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) friendly solution the decision was made in favor of a javascript approach that performance-wise nowadays really should not be an issue for modern browsers.

But lets take a clearer look at the actual features and its implementation of this blog:

### Text Elements
First let‘s start with the most obvious one, the text styling. While the overall appearance can be easily recognizes by just taking a glimpse at this very site with its **bold** and *italic* as well as regular stylings there are some more advanced elements that need a tiny bit more markup in order to make use of them.

<span>Highlighted elements</span>{:.highlighted} or single **highlighted**{:.highlighted} words for example can be triggered as follows.

``` markdown
<span>Highlighted elements</span>{:.highlighted}
single **highlighted**{:.highlighted} words
```
{:.block}

of course there are also basic elements like a bullet list as well as a numbered list available

- The Vision of Christ that thou dost see
- Is my Vision’s Greatest Enemy.
	- Thine has a great hook nose like thine;
	- Mine has a snub nose like to mine.
		- Thine is the friend of All Mankind;
- Mine speaks in parables to the Blind.  
Thine loves the same world that mine hates; [ ... ]

1. Thy Heaven doors are my Hell Gates.
2. Socrates taught what Melitus
3. Loathd as a Nation’s bitterest Curse;
	4. And Caiphas was in his own Mind
	5. A benefactor to Mankind.
6. Both read the Bible day & night,
7. But thou readst black where I read white.

``` markdown
- The Vision of Christ that thou dost see
- Is my Vision’s Greatest Enemy.
[...]

1. Thy Heaven doors are my Hell Gates.
2. Socrates taught what Melitus
[...]
```

Taking a look at the first sentences of this blog post there was already another form of text styling displayed, that usually allows the author to kind of lead the readers to the topic instead of confronting them rightaway. I am of course speaking of the introduction sequence, which easily gets triggered by applying the class `intro` to the corresponding text container or—if prefered—using the *kramdown syntax* `{:.intro}`.

Regarding quotes there are two different implementations available. While the default markdown *block quote* builds a text heavy element it is also possible to add much more prominent, screen-wide quote that creates a magazine-like appearance.

> Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You haveno sovereignty where we gather.   
We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I addressyou with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself alwaysspeaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturallyindependent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moralright to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have truereason to fear.  
\- [John Perry Barlow, February 8, 1996](https://www.eff.org/de/cyberspace-independence)

We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice
accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.
{:.quote}

And then - of course - there are **heading components** that structure the block post in multiple sections. Since the major `h1` element is reserved for the actual title of the blogpost there are five headings available to be used in the flowing text.

`h2` should be used as a subheading of `h1` and divides the text into scannable blocks. It serves as a chapter heading for the blog post and guides the reader to specific sections of the article.

Its successor `h3` gets also used in situations where usually a `h2` would be applied but it just does not hold that much information to justify a major header element.  
While `h2` and `h3` serve as the most important headings to divide the article in subsections there is also a `h4` element which allows to create even smaller parts.

`h5` and `h6` are actually styled the same way but where `h5` gets displayed in a common way (as a block element) the `h6` header triggers some javascript that displays it in line with the following text block and therefore can be used in situation where it needs to be placed next to the actual content.

## Sample Heading h2
{: style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 0"}
### Sample Heading h3
{: style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 0"}
#### Sample Heading h4
{: style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 0"}
##### Sample Heading h5
{: style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 0"}
###### Sample Heading h6
E.g. this heading can be used to represent the responding participant in a written interview or to add a date or location to an article.

``` markdown
## Sample Heading h2
### Sample Heading h3
#### Sample Heading h4
##### Sample Heading h5
###### Sample Heading h6
E.g. this heading can be used to represent the responding
participant in a written interview or to add a date
or location to an article.
```

### Sidenotes
Based on the original work of [Edward Tuft](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) the blog section of this website also features a solution that enables the author to add remarks, annotations and additional information to the text without breaking reading fluency or context.
Simular to the idea presented in the [tufte-css repository on github](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) an easy to use *html structure* triggers a **sidenote** which will either be <span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote__toggle">pulled to the left</span><span class="sidenote__note">This is a sample for a default sidenote. Expanded on larger screens. Inline on mobile.</span></span> side of the blog post where it is shown permanently expanded on larger screens or — default for smaller screens or enabled by `class="inline"` — <span class="sidenote inline"><span class="sidenote__toggle">placed inline</span><span class="sidenote__note">This sidetone is permanently placed inline. On larger screens as well as on mobile. Useful in case of overlapping elements or if the information should not be placed on a prominent spot.</span></span>  where a simple click unveils or hides the addition information.

``` html
<span class="sidenote"> <!-- possible to add "inline" -->
	<span class="sidenote__toggle">
		<!--
		This is the trigger.
		-->
	</span>
	<span class="sidenote__note">
		<!--
		Text placed in this part of the sidenote
		will be shown as additional information
		associated with the trigger element.
		-->
	</span>
</span>
```
{:.block}

### Code and Blockcode
Raw elements are quite an important styling element for developer centric blog posts or if an output should be mad available without any additional distracting stylings.
Besides the implementation done on my side the underlying static blog engine Jekyll already comes with the build in support for [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) which is a very well working and easy to use syntax highlighter written in ruby that supports a huge amount of languages including — of course — all the major language and markup formats.
The actual syntax highlighting itself — provided by the [Pygments stylesheet](http://pygments.org/) can be triggered by adding the corresponding language name to the markdown code block.

```markdown
like: ```markdown
can easily achieved by adding the
coding languages name to the initial coding tag ```html

This part for example highlights the markdown language:

# This is a title
With **bold** and *italic* fonts.
```
{:.block}

Besides the ready to use syntax highlighting adding the class `block` to the code section adds an additional white background to the section and also pulls the content on mobile screen widths slightly to the right and therefore allows to make use of the otherwise unused left and right screen margins.

```
A white background can be added to the code section
with an additional
{:.block}
in a new line after the ending ```
```
{:.block}

Since the code section is build with the idea in mind that the actual content should not be altered by the style sheet of this site, `white-space: pre;` prevents the browser from adding additional line breaks besides the one present in the source code or added with `<br>`-Elements.
While this might lead to overfloating code blocks which are to wider than the available screen space a little js-function is monitoring those events in the background and triggers an additional information sign in case there are

```
This line contains about 500 characters and is certainly wider than most screens can display. Therefore there will an additional "scroll" sign triggered in case this line of code would otherwise be cut off. If you can read this text passage in its entirety you could resize your browser window to create the same effect manually and therefore get an idea of how this function works and why it might be useful in some situations.
```
{:.block}

### Images

Media content—of course—is one of the major attention grabbing elements some could at to a blog post. As a style spent to visualize thoughts and provide examples (or pictures of funny cats if you prefer) the configuration of this blog section features 4 different implementations.
The first one already initiated this sub-section. A plain image without any additional styling, no added titles or information while making use of the full width of the text.

The default image integration moreover  allows to add a title as well as n sub-title, while the whole syntax does not get unnecessarily complicated at all. In order to make use of n title the usual—and most of the time already present—`alt` could  be used, while for the sake of consistence it is also possible to add `data-title` alongside the `data-subtitle` attribute.
Additionally to this easy process of adding additional information, both options—title as well as subtitle—parse their content via a JavaScript markdown function and therefore are able to even work with standard flavored markdown strings.

![Sample Image by Rodrigo Soares](/assets/img/page/blog/sample_full.jpg){: data-title="A single sample image with title" data-subtitle="Photo by [Rodrigo Soares](https://unsplash.com/@rodi01) on Unsplash"}

``` markdown
![Sample Image by Rodrigo Soares](/assets/img/page/blog/sample_full.jpg){: data-title="A single sample image with title" data-subtitle="Photo by [Rodrigo Soares](https://unsplash.com/@rodi01) on Unsplash"}
```
{:.block}

Furthermore there are two multi-image settings available that equip the user to either add two images side-by-side or—in case there is a need for three or more images in a row—trigger a mostly JavaScript based gallery build.
Differently to the single images the side-by-side approach needs an additional class `.two` added **after** the integration of both image.
However the earlier presented approach to add title of sub-title to the element can be used in exactly the same way, though it should be noted that both images are titled as a group rather than an individual media element.

![Sample Image by Rodrigo Soares](/assets/img/page/blog/sample_full.jpg)
![Sample Image by Rodrigo Soares](/assets/img/page/blog/sample_full.jpg)
{:.two data-title="Two images besides each other" data-subtitle="left: the first one, right: the second"}

``` markdown

{:.two data-title="Two images besides each other" data-subtitle="left: the first one, right: the second"}
```
{:.block}

Since it was my intention to develop a blogging tool that does not add much bloat to the already present markdown syntaxt but of course provides all the needed elements to describe it as a fully featured blogging solution, this website does use quite a bit of JavaScript in certain situations.
Triggered by the plain HTML output a gallery could be easily build by just stacking 3 or more images beneath each other.
Once again, all above mentioned possibilities to apply (sub-)titles can be used in order to display additional images.
While the initial process of building the gallery does need to calculate all image sizes in the background, it is crucial for the script to download all filed upfront and before the gallery-slider in its entirety can be presented to the audience. To prevent this process (which depends heavily on the available internet speed) from breaking the appearance and flow of the post or even blocking the website itself, the loading process is simply indicated by a spinning circle until the ready to be added gallery can be integrated in the text structure as a whole.

```

Besides that it also should be noted that all images—**except the gallery images**— can easily be lazyloaded by skipping the usual `src` part of the image and instead adding the corresponding path via an additional `data-src` attribute. Also required is an additional class with the value `lazyload`.

![Sample Image by Rodrigo Soares](){:.lazyload data-src="/assets/img/page/blog/sample_full.jpg"}

### Update + Attention
Before ending this rather technical blog post, that neither fully explains the underlying techniques nor says much about the purpose of this site but rather serves as a handbook on how to use the specific classes and implementations to provide this kind of a well presented article view which I intendet to create, I would like to shed the light on a last item that most often is quite important to a lot authors.
While writing a story or an introduction to a pieces of software you basically take a snapshot of the current setting and build your whole story around that situation.  
Our lives are not static and so aren't most surely the topics most authors are writing about. So in my opinion there should be an easily to recognize setup that allows to highlight updates, additions or just basic information that should not be forgotten.  

Sometimes it's the small things that are quite important and should not be overlooked.  
This section allows you without much efforts to highlight one or more paragraphs of text and add a dedicated title as well as an info element at the bottom of the block.
The corresponding code elements that trigger the js-build can be found below, but please remember the following things:
{:info="Do Remember!" info_sub="SubHeading added at 2018-05-07 18:59:01 +0200"}

- every new paragraph that should be added to the 'info block section' must have a new *kramdown trigger* added in order to work properly
- the trigger element can only be added to `p`, `ul` or `ol` elements. Everything else is currently not considered beeing transformed to a *info block section*
- multiple *info block sections* that do have a matching (as in **exactly**) trigger will be counted as one and integrated in each other
- same goes for sections that do have the same **title** while the subtitle of the `n+2` is empty
- if the title of those elements is empty they will be displaied with the title **"Info"**
- in case titles are not matching or empty subtitles will not be taking in account to check for similar title-elements
- however if titles are matching and parent- as well as child-elements do have sub-titles associated to their *info block section* they do have to match in order for beeing integrated into each other
{:info="Do Remember!" info_sub="SubHeading added at 2018-05-07 18:59:01 +0200"}

```markdown
Some content.
{:info="Do Remember!" info_sub="SubHeading added at 2018-05-07 18:59:01 +0200"}

And potentially even more content with the same trigger, which—in the end—will get integrated in each other and form one *info block section*.
{:info="Do Remember!" info_sub="SubHeading added at 2018-05-07 18:59:01 +0200"}
```

It might look like this is the end of the blog post but I am more than convinced that there actually might be an update soon. Since the intention of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the possibilities and implemented features of the blog section, this blog post will recieve some new attention whenever some additions to the blog are worth mentioning.

Now take a look around and hopfully find something that is interesting enaugh for you to come back once in a while and spend some time on my blog.

Oh and I definitely should mention: If you do find anything that makes you want to talk to me (an issue or a bug, somthing you would like to hear more about or a lazy day where you definitely need some company) just head over to my [Contact Section](/about#contact) and reach out to me. I promise I do my very best to reply as fast as possible.

Now have a great day!
