          <p>Bastian uses Twitter mostly as a news platform and to keep up with updates of noteworthy individuals. Sometimes he also tweets about things he cares about - always critical, political, dangerously ironic and with a touch of humor. Feel free to ping or add him to the people you follow on Twitter.
