    In case you were wondering who Bastian Kroggel is, what this site is all about or how to get in touch with him? — The following sections might held some answers for you.
toc_about: |
    Short introduction to the who and why of this website + an in-depth look at the author and his intentions. Enjoy the ride.
    This site presents a—by all means not comprehensive—overview of the author, his ideas and intentions and the underlying reason which led to the development of this webpage.
    In case of questions or inquiries there is also a dedicated section where all of the major points of connection can be found.
intro: |
    The idea is simple, the approach as well—yet the implementation holds some challenges.
    The current iteration of the internet is shaped by the possibilities that social networks provide their user base with. In reverse that however also means that a very little group of companies concentrate—at least a substantial amount of—the entirety of user generated content on their own platforms.

    I honestly do not mind those practices, they actually work fairly well and allow a lot of people to participate on the web who otherwise would not be able to express their own thoughts.  
    Nevertheless those platforms most of the time lack search machine compatibility and are rather a data grave than an open and easily accessible catalog of thoughts, opinions and information.

    That in mind I created a personal counterpoint to the common state of art.
    Surely I integrated a highly customized Twitter feed in my site—convenience + reach are still variables that should not be underrated—but the main aspect of this site is a simple yet highly effective blog system that provides an entirely customizable and plain text-files based experience that not just allows to back up all information at any time but also to keep all data in my  own possession in the first place—features that are still highly missed on social networks these days.

    All together this website should provide an insight in my own opinions and ideas, act as a silo + wiki for notes I do like to keep track of and at the same time would like to share with the world and of course it should be the one point of contact some needs to reach out on the web in order to get hold of all publicly available and confirmed information regarding myself.

    Anyways, I honestly hope I am able to provide you with the exact details you are looking for and—of course—I am always happy to hear from you.
    <!-- Anyways, if the above matches with your intentions of visiting my site I sincerely hope I am able to provide you with all of the details you are looking for. And if not—I am of course always happy to hear from you. -->

    Sincerely,

about: |
    What drives me is an urge to keep pace with the constantly evolving digital environment, what distinguishes me is the broad knowledge about not just the theoretical and strategic approaches but also the technical details and actual ways of implementation—the development.

    While my educational background at Zeppelin University Friedrichshafen on the shores of Lake Constance equips me with a generalistic yet in certain areas highly focused perspective, my personal skills provide me with the ability to also transfer those information into an actual production ready solution.
    <br><br>
    Besides a general enthusiasm for technology the spectrum of interests also covers creative areas like a strong preference for contemporary literature, for simple yet effective design and a long-standing experience as a piano playing musician.

    Probably on the road right now with my motorcycle.  
    — The way of clearing my mind.
timeline_intro: |
    Outline and insight of my current and past professional as well as educational experiences + career. By no means should this be seen as a comprehensive, detailed and complete timeline rather than a short summary of the—in my eyes—most important waypoints of my background.

    If you would like to know how to get added to that list feel free to head over to my [Contact Section](#contact) and get in touch with me.
